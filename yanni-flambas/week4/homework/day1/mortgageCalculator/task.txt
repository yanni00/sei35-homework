Calculate the monthly required payment given the other variables as input (look up the necessary variables)

**Method1
M monthly payment
P principal
r monthly interest rate, annual interest divided by 12
n is number of payments ( duration of the months being paid off )

M = P*((r(1+r)**n)/()(1+r)**n -1))


example

M = ?
P = $100,000
r = 0.005
n = 180

M = 100_000*((0.005*(1+0.005)**180))/(((1+0.005)**180)-1)

**Method2


M = ?
l = loan
r = monthly interest rate, annual interest divided by 12
n =is number of payments ( duration of the months being paid off )


i = (1+r/12)**(12/12)-1 # %P.A made into % per month *1 cheeky hack
annuity = (1-(1/(1+i))**n)/i #work out ammount owed vs time to pay off

payment = loan/annuity #Work out the payment with loan and months with interest included
