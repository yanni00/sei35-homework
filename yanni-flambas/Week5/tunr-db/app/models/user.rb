  # By using 'has_secure_password', ActiveRecord will expect your

  # the encrypted version of the password for a user - this requires
  # the 'bcrypt' gem to be in our Gemfile.
  #
  # When we now create a user via
  # User.create ..., password: 'chicken'
  # the plaintext password will be encrypted on the fly and stored
  # in the 'password_digest'
